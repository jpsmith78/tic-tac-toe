## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Approach Taken
This was my first project using these front-end tools, so I focused on just getting the game logic to work and then styling it afterwards.  At this point it is mostly if/else statements determining the winner.  I would definitely like to go back into this and make it more succinct. I was happy to get the game to keep track of how many times each result had happened.

## Future Goals
I'd love to streamline the game logic and make the design a little more responsive
